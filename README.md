# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

This project is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning classification model that predicts whether a breast tumor is **Malignant** or **Benign** using the Breast Cancer dataset from `scikit-learn`.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Breast cancer classification is a supervised learning problem where the goal is to classify tumors based on numeric features extracted from medical images.

This project uses **Logistic Regression**, a simple and effective classification algorithm, to learn patterns from the data and make predictions on unseen cases.
