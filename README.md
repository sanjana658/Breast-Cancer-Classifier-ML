# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

This project is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning classification model that predicts whether a breast tumor is **Malignant** or **Benign** using the Breast Cancer dataset from `scikit-learn`.

Project Overview
Breast cancer classification is a supervised learning problem where the goal is to classify tumors based on numeric features extracted from medical images.

This project uses **Logistic Regression**, a simple and effective classification algorithm, to learn patterns from the data and make predictions on unseen cases.

This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for real medical diagnosis.
